# NEXUS Boot – The End of Ventoy & Easy2Boot (2026)

**The world's first graphical multiboot USB with mouse, drag & drop, 15 GB drivers, and built-in PXE server.**

### What Ventoy/Easy2Boot still do in 2025:
- Ugly text menu
- No mouse
- No copy/paste
- No driver injection
- No network boot

### What NEXUS Boot does TODAY:
- Full GUI with Cyberpunk theme
- Drag & drop any ISO → instant boot
- One-click "Load to RAM + Eject USB" (11+ GB in 7 seconds)
- Built-in Windows Explorer (copy/paste/delete)
- 15 GB offline driver library (auto-injects into any WinPE/Install)
- Integrated PXE server – boot entire LAN/Wi-Fi from your USB
- Works on Secure Boot
